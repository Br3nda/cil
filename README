Overview
--------

'cil' allows easy command-line creation of an issue tracker. It saves each
issue locally and in plain text. Commands are given such that these issues can
be added, edited and listed easily.

===============================================================================

Quick Start
-----------

Once installed, you should be able to run 'cil':

 $ cil --help

Now change directory to your current development project. To save the issues,
'cil' requires setting up, so issue the 'init' command:

 $ cil init

This creates a '.cil' file and an 'issues/' directory.

Then add an issue. An editor will pop-up and you fill in the details:

 $ cil add

After you've added it, you can see a representation of the issue. Now you can
list all the issues by using the 'list' command:

 $ cil list

You can see what the issue name is by looking at the 'Issue' title. Imagine it
is '1208598003' (which by default is the time from epoch). To see your issue
again, use the 'show' command:

 $ cil show 1208598003

Another reporting command is 'summary':

 $ cil summary

The columns show 'Name', 'Status', 'CreatedBy' and 'Summary'.

Shucks, we've noticed we got something wrong in the issue. Let's edit it:

 $ cil edit 1208598003

Save your changes and exit your editor. The issue is now saved. Try showing it
again to make sure your changed are correct.

We have just found out more about the issue so let's add a comment to it:

 $ cil comment 1208598003

When you show the issue again, you'll see the comment has been added and is now
displayed.

That's it for now. As you can see, if you've played with any kind of bug/issue
tracker before, 'cil' is straightforward.

===============================================================================

Future Work
-----------

Currently, cil is still young. There are a number of improvements I wish to do
on it but already it is useable as a small and personal issue tracker.
