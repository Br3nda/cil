When we add issues and their comments and attachments, there is the possibility
that you don't actually check in the correct files at the same time. This
command will help to figure out whether you have all the files around.

This command will also check each command for validity. For example, if you
change the 'StatusAllowedList' in your '.cil' file, then this will help
determine if there are any issues set to now invalid statuses.
